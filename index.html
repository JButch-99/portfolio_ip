          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p>
            I wouldn't say I'm too much of a gamer. However, if I'm given free time I do have several favorites I like to use to pass the time. One of my favorite genres tends to be single player games. While I enjoy joining with my online groups, spending time together as we face off in activities or just good fun, I can find the enjoyment of alone time. Here is a list of some of the games I personally enjoy:
          </p>

          <ul class="ed">
            <li>Destiny 2</li>
            <li>Kingdom Hearts</li>
            <li>Metroid</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>The Legend of Zelda</li>
            <li>Animal Crossing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While I have other favorites I like to entertain myself with, these series are some of my personal favorites. As for non-virtual games, I am an avid player of some trading card games. My main one is Yu-Gi-Oh, but I have been experimenting online with Magic the Gathering. I also like to play casual games of chess, Gloomhaven, and have been trying out D&D.

          <h3>Interests</h3>
          <p>
            Some of the interests I end up enjoying is more solitary ones. In my free time, I like to tinker with 3D models to print with my A1 mini. I like to read when I have chance, mostly covering adventure novels. I generally don't watch TV or movies, but I do enjoy listening to YouTube videos while I multitask. Other smaller side hobbies I have is making Lego models, playing frisbee with my dog, and spending time with my friends. Here are a small list of books I personally have enjoyed reading:
          </p>
          <ul class="ed">
            <li>The Lord of the Rings series</li>
            <li>The Guardians of Ga'Hoole</li>
            <li>World War Z</li>
            <li>The Chronicles of Narnia</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
            I am an immense enjoyer of music. I have been in musical productions, and as a child I've been helping my family with a local theater. My sister also exposed me to various musicals and my caretaker from my childhood allowed me to listen to some music that helped mold some of my personal tastes today. I am mainly someone who enjoys musical songs, their catchy rhythm and delving into the depths of the lyrics. From my venture into the internet throughout the years, from listening to radios, or from accidentally stumbling upon these additions to my playlist. Here is a short list of some of my personal favorite bands and musical productions:

          <p>
            This is a project with the instructions of Fidgetech to practice bootstrap elements. Using bootstrap, I was able to make a rough recreation of the Wikipedia homepage as concept. This webpage does not reflect a specific time, and is mainly filled with lorem ipsum to be a placeholder. It has links within the webpage to resources provided by Wikipedia. Many of the content listed within is meant to mimic as closely as possible, just without the functionality of JavaScript.

I was given free reign to create this webpage to make my own portfolio. This will be regularly updated as I continue my journey in the course. It will provide info regarding me, my skills, my work history, my projects, and much important info regarding me.

          <span class="question">Why did I choose this course?</span> I chose the Fidgetech's Web and Mobile App development program was mainly due my interests in the field. My family is deeply into the technology, and I've grew up with it's presence. I have been interested in many of this subject's fields, ever since trying a multimedia course and various computer classes from my time in primary school. I like to create things, and to combine some interest of mine together. While initially nervous, from exposure to the course's contents I managed to hone my limited skills to the webpage you've see before you today.

At my current stage, I can make webpages and utilize GitHub and make git pages. Eventually I will be able to launch websites and learn to add functionality to my projects. I will learn how to properly format and organize my projects in to make it easier to read. I shall learn Bootstrap and the grid system in order to perfect the layout for my projects. In fact, you are currently reading my work. This webpage was made thanks to the instructions given by Fidgetech.
