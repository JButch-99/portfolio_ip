            This document is a brief summary and info sheet for <span class="daisy">Daisy</span>. Daisy is an mini australian shepard. This was made early into my coding course, so it lacks basic css or even divs. It's mainly meant to serve to learn html and practice it with. With this, you will be able to look into the beginning of my coding journey.

          <h3>Wikipedia Clone</h3>
          <p>
            This is a project with the instructions of Fidgetech to practice bootstrap elements. Using bootstrap, I was able to make a rough recreation of the Wikipedia homepage as concept. This webpage does not reflect a specific time, and is mainly filled with lorem ipsum to be a placeholder. It has links within the webpage to resources provided by Wikipedia. Many of the content listed within is meant to mimic as closely as possible, just without the functionality of JavaScript.
